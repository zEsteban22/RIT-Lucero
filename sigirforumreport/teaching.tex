\subsection{Teaching and Learning}
\label{sec:teaching}

To seed the discussion for this working group, various members explained how the Information Retrieval course was taught at their institute. As Juanma had already discussed how they teach at the University of Granada (see above), others described their courses and experiences.

{\bf Discussion}:  From the various perspectives, it was clear that there was a number of key concepts that were felt to be fundamental to teaching Information Retrieval. From the discussion it was also clear that the lecturers wanted to give students hands-on experience so that they could see the impact and effect of the different components i.e. what does tokenization and stemming do to the size of vocabulary, the size of the index, and the influence on precision and recall. Also, from the descriptions there was a consensus towards teaching IR in an inquiry led manner - focusing mainly on the science (rather than the engineering). In this way the lectures and course work would be focused on presenting experimental contexts in which the students could go off and conduct experiments to gain insights and understanding into the effect and influence of different factors (rather than just told what would happen). In this way, students would become more scientific in their approach, and know how to conduct an experiment (aim, method, results, conclusion). This was seen to be an important skill to learn, both from a research point of view, but also from a very practical point of view, i.e. many students will become data scientists, and so they need to be trained to be methodical in their approach.

With this in mind, we drew up a table of different facets of the courses, roughly split into Indexing, Retrieval, Analysis and Evaluation (see Table~\ref{tbl_teaching}). We considered the two different levels, high (i.e. using/configuring the apps) and low (i.e. programming and coding algorithms). The reason for considering the different levels, was that different cohorts of students have different skill sets or the focus of the course maybe more oriented towards technical under the hood skills versus high level understanding and usage. At the different levels, we considered the different apps being built during the hackathon along with other apps that would also help support teaching and learning in IR. Table~\ref{tbl_teaching} summarises the different apps and some of the things that we would like students to be able to do with them. For example, consider a lecture on stemming and the following questions: what is the influence of stemming and what are the differences between no stemming, porter stemming and krovetz stemming, in terms of vocabulary and index size, and performance? Having apps that let students easily configure and run different stemmers, then be able to conduct retrieval experiments, measure the performance, and analyze/inspect the index, would then enable them to form their own insights into the effects of stemming. On the other hand, during the retrieval algorithms lectures, different comparisons between models can be made, and if required new algorithms developed. In terms of further analysis, an app (ResultAnalyzerApp) could be used to help analyze the influence of document length normalization - does changing the $b$ parameter in BM25 actually effect the length of documents that are retrieved?
While these are simple examples - it was felt that his on-boarding stage helps students to contextualize and understand the taught material - and enables them to go onto conduct more advanced evaluations.
